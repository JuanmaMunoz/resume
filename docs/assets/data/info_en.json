  "positionDescription": "<p>I have 18 years of experience in the software industry, having worked for major companies such as Repsol, Vodafone, Línea Directa, Banco Santander, among others. In many of these projects, I have been responsible for designing and leading the front-end architecture from scratch, which has allowed me to build solid expertise in this area. My role has not only involved creating robust architectures, but also providing technical leadership to front-end development teams, establishing best practices to ensure the delivery of scalable, high-quality applications.</p><p>In addition to leading, I am actively involved in development, which allows me to stay up-to-date with the latest technological trends and continue contributing as just another developer. This hands-on and current approach is key to ensuring the success of the projects I lead.</p><p>I have strong knowledge of back-end and advanced experience in UX, which gives me a comprehensive view of the technical needs of any application. This enables me not only to provide support in these areas but also to oversee and ensure that the proper standards are met in both, contributing to the creation of well-structured, functional applications with an excellent user experience. My holistic approach ensures that all aspects of development, from design to implementation, align for the successful completion of the project.</p><p>In 2022, I had the opportunity to lead the architecture of Repsol’s ARIA project, which was a key component of the Stock Control application. This project was recognized in 2023 with the Best in Class award at Expoquimia. Thanks to this success, I became a reference for Repsol in front-end architecture, consolidating my role in defining innovative and high-performance solutions within the company.</p><p>Currently, I am leading the development of the front-end architecture for an application designed to manage the digital signing of all proposals issued in the Parliament of Deputies. This project is based on a modular architecture of microsites, accompanied by the creation of a custom component library. This solution not only optimizes development speed and robustness but also allows for greater independence between modules, positioning itself as a key innovation in the future of web development.</p>",
