  "positionDescription": "<p>I have 18 years of experience in the software industry.</p><p>I have worked for major companies such as Repsol, Vodafone, Línea Directa, Banco Santander, among others. In some of these projects, I have had the opportunity to design and lead front-end architecture from scratch, gaining significant experience in this area. Besides designing the architecture, technically leading various front-end teams, and establishing best practices for creating solid and scalable applications, I enjoy being involved in the application development as another developer, which allows me to stay updated with technological advancements.</p><p>I have advanced knowledge in back-end and UX, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the technical needs of any application, enabling me to offer support in these areas.</p><p>In 2022, I led the architecture of Repsol's ARIA project, which was part of the Stock Control application and was awarded Best in Class at Expoquimia in 2023.</p><p>Currently, I am involved in the architecture of microsites, along with the creation of a custom component library. This new type of architecture allows us to create applications quickly, robustly, and independently, representing the future of web development.</p>",
