# Resume

An interactive platform documenting my professional evolution and technical expertise. A space dedicated to software architecture where I share my projects and publications, aiming to provide value and resources to the developer community.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Angular 20
- Rxjs 20
- Bootstrap 5.3

## Install dependecies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `docs/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
